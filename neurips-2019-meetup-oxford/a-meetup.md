# A Meetup?

Summarizing my experience at the meetup between December 9-13, 2019 as a computational biologist, along with notes on the talks and tutorials that I attended.  
organized by people at the Department of Statistics, so naturally most of the local events were related to bayesian stuff  


many thanks to Bobby and Sha for organizing the event!

My experience:

* was positive
* event was free, so not many people came

Big takeaways:

* machine learning is much more than just
* still many frameworks yet to be established
